# rareMetalPricesVisualisation
The Johnson Matthey Base Prices (the “Prices”) are the company’s quoted prices for their customers of wholesale quantities of platinum group metals set by their trading desks in the USA, Hong Kong and the UK. 
The Prices are for the metals in sponge form with minimum purities of 99.95% for platinum and palladium, and 99.9% for rhodium, iridium and ruthenium.

This repository provides source code to visualise an animated line plot and static multi bar plot visualisations of the changes in Prices over the years since 2000 which gives an insight on how with respect to demands and market situations, the prices have altered.
